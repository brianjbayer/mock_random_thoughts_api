# mock_random_thoughts_api
This is a **very** simple test double for
[random_thoughts_api](https://github.com/brianjbayer/random_thoughts_api)
primarily intended for Acceptance Testing/End-to-End (E2E)
Testing of
[random_thoughts_api_e2e](https://github.com/brianjbayer/random_thoughts_api_e2e).

---

## Swagger Generated Server
This double is customized from a Swagger-generated server to meet
the specific needs to `random_thoughts_api_e2e`.

> This server was generated by the
> [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
> project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
> from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Here Be Dragons
This Swagger-generated test double has known (and high severity)
**vulnerabilities** and should **not** be used in a publicly
accessible (production) environment.

The spirit of this double is *non-attachment* to be easily
replaced and regenerated from the `random_thoughts_api`
Swagger document adding the minimal necessary customizations.

## Operating

### Specifying the Port
This server has been customized to run by default on port `3000`.

To specify the port on which the server runs, set the `PORT`
environment variable, for example...
```
PORT=8080
```

### Running the Server
To run the server, run...
```
npm start
```

### Using the Included Swagger UI
When the server is running, you can view the Swagger UI
interface at `http://localhost:{PORT}/docs`
(e.g. http://localhost:3000/docs).

## Specifications

> This project leverages the mega-awesome
> [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools)
> middleware which does most all the work.
